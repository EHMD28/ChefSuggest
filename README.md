# Chef Suggest

![logo](assets/images/ChefSuggestLogo.png)

Chef Suggest is a meal-suggestion program that comes equipped with a lot of
functionality designed to help you decide what to make every day. There is a 
desktop and Android version (not IOS). **This project is still currently under
development, so you won't be able to use it.**

I decided to keep the code for the desktop and Android project in the same
repository for ease of code reuse. See [desktop](desktop/) directory for
desktop application code and see [android-app](android-app) directory for
android app code.
